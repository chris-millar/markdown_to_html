some initial paragraph to capture
across multiple
lines
# Header one

<p>existing paragraph tag</p>
<div>existing other html</div>

    # not actually a header, but still a [link](google.com) with text around
onto the next line for the same paragraph

# header with indent
# header with indent
# header with indent

### [link](google.com) can start the header

Hello there broken [](google.com) link and another one [here](a.i)

####### not a header, too long
###           but this is         [link](google.com)
The space between the text and link should be preserved but the rest should be trimmed

links do not wrap lines [link]
(google.com)

This paragraph should be
# header
broken and split into 2 by the header

multiple blank lines between are preserved



nested links [a link with a link to [google](bing.com)](google.com)

but links where there are brackets and parens in the name and url should be fine
[Check out these (cool) [of text] as the link name](bing.com?query(a)=b&bar[1]=one)

some hashes inside text will not be ## headers

How are you?
What's going on?

## Another Header

This is a paragraph [with an inline link](http://google.com). Neat, eh?

## This is a header [with a link](http://yahoo.com)
